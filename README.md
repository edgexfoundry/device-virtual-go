## Overview
The virtual device service simulates different kinds of [devices](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.1/general/Definitions/#device) to generate events and readings to the [core data](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.1/microservices/core/data/Ch-CoreData/) micro service, and users send commands and get responses through the [command and control](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.1/microservices/core/command/Ch-Command/) micro service. These features of the virtual device services are useful when executing functional or performance tests without having any real devices.
## Usage
Users can refer to [the document](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.1/microservices/device/virtual/Ch-VirtualDevice/) to learn how to use this device service.
